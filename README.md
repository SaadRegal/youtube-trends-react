This project was a front end challenge.

Project Assessment:
YouTube Trends is a front-end application that was developed in a hurry to show the latest video trends from YouTube.

New features:
Right now it's showing the latest trends only for the United States, but we would like to have a possibility of selecting a specific country to see the latest trends there. Also, we want to specify a category of trending videos, selector is already added in filters, but categories are hardcoded, we want to fetch it from Youtube API, see (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videoCategories/list). The last thing is that we want to implement "infinite scroll", so more videos should be loaded when we scroll to the bottom of the page.

Bug fix:
When you mouse over the video, you can see on every element of the page "Likes", but it shows always 0, please fix it.
When we're trying to open some video to play it doesn't work please fix these bugs.
Slide-nav button (gear) is broken, when you click on it, nothing happens, but it should open filters, please fix it.
When slide-nav is opened, the close button is also didn't work, fix it also.
On filters slide-nav, we have "Count of videos on the page" slider, if we trying to select more than 50 videos on the page it throws the error. But expected behavior that we can select more than 50 videos (ex. 148 or 200) and see results on the main page
When we open the video on a separate page, filters button should be hidden.
In case if passed wrong video id, the user should be redirected on a page with youtube videos list.
Selected filters should be saved, so after we will refresh the page, filters should be the same as we chose before.

Notes:
* List of countries can be found in the config file
* List of categories should be loaded from Youtube API
* You may add new dependencies in package.json (if needed)
